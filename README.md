Pterodactyl eggs are made by parckervcp ([ParkerVCP](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs)) but modified by me. I use these eggs on my hosting platform ([0x001 Host](https://0x001.cloud)) and wanted to share them with you.

Mostly what's new is just a way for users to change startup flags manually, and added default flags. The user can't change RAM, just Aikar's Flags, RAM is handled by {{SERVER_MEMORY}} and JAR name is handled by {{SERVER_JAR}}.

Soon I will add more as I progress.

If you are reading this it looks like you are looking to add an egg to your server.

1. Download any of the json files located in the folders below.
2. It's easiest to right click the raw button and save as.
3. In your panel go to the Nests section in the admin part of the panel
4. Click the green Import Egg button
5. Browse to the json file you saved earlier
6. Select what nest you want to put the egg in.
7. If you want a new nest you need to create it before importing the egg.

<h3>You must restart your daemon after importing an egg if you are using 0.7. This is not required on 1.X</h3>
