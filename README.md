Pterodactyl eggs are made by parckervcp ([ParkerVCP](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs)) but modified by me. I use these eggs on my hosting platform ([0x001 Host](https://0x001.cloud)) and wanted to share them with you.

Mostly what's new is just a way for users to change startup flags manually, and added default flags. The user can't change RAM, just Aikar's Flags, RAM is handled by {{SERVER_MEMORY}} and JAR name is handled by {{SERVER_JAR}}.

Soon I will add more as I progress.
